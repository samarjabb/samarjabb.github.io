As a recent graduate of Conestoga College's Computer Programming/Analysis program and a former refugee, I am excited to bring my unique perspective and experiences to a challenging and rewarding career in the tech industry. I am looking for an entry level position as a software developer.

With a solid foundation in programming languages such as C#, Java, and JavaScript, I am well-equipped to tackle complex coding projects and contribute to the development of software at your organization.

Having overcome the challenges of displacement and resettlement, I possess a resilience and determination in the face of difficult tasks. I approach challenges with creativity and adaptability, and I am committed to delivering high-quality results. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I bring a unique perspective and a drive to succeed. I would welcome the opportunity to chat about how I can contribute to your organization's success.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy exploring my creative side through drawing (lead) and paint (acrylic) and crochet, and I am always listening to an audiobook! Currently listening to Maybe You Should Talk to Someone by Lori Gottlieb.
